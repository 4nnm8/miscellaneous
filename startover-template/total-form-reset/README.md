What you cannot custom without JavaScript ?

  - Remove the cross in Firefox for INPUTs "date", "time" and "datetime-local"
  
    --> Can be removed with "required" attribute but maybe you
        don't want this field to be mandatory.

  - Numbers focus highlight in Firefox for the same INPUTs

  - Background color of hovered OPTION tag in all browsers
  
  - Scrollbars except in Webkit
